# üí´ About Me:
<br>
Hi! I'm Dante üëã
‚Å£‚Å£<br> <br> 
As a Co-Founder at Ut Simplex, I have had the opportunity to participate in numerous projects across various industries, including insurance, commerce, law, tourism, and logistics. Despite my strong analytical and management skills, I am currently working as a Full Stack Engineer. Throughout my career, I have collaborated with companies from around the world, including Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, and, last but not least, Argentina.
<br>
I began my journey as a solo Winform C# developer with SQL Compact + ADO.Net, which laid the foundation for my later transition to ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and SQL Server. I developed a curiosity for Node.js during this time, and it wasn't long before I started exploring Front-End technologies such as Angular, Ionic, Angular Material, and Bootstrap.
<br>
I also have experience with Cloud Technologies, specifically Google Cloud Platform + Firebase. Over the last four to five years, I have worked extensively with Cloud Functions, GitHub Actions, Ionic, Angular Material, C#, Entity Framework and SQL, as well as tools like Jira and Confluence.
<br>
While you'll find a selection of my repositories here, it's just a snapshot of my ongoing journey. I regularly update and add new projects, so stay tuned for more!
<br>
Currently, I'm exploring opportunities where I can leverage my skills as a Front-end or Full-stack developer. I'm also excited about stepping into new territories, and would warmly welcome positions involving Nest and Node.
